Aggregated Discovery Service (ADS)
==================================



Discovery services for endpoints, clusters, routes,
and listeners are retained in the package `envoy.api.v2` for backwards
compatibility with existing management servers. New development in discovery
services should proceed in the package `envoy.service.discovery.v2`.
