  }

.. _envoy_api_field_admin.v2alpha.ClusterStatus.name:

name
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Name of the cluster.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_admin.v2alpha.ClusterStatus.added_via_api:

added_via_api
  (`bool <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Denotes whether this cluster was added via API or configured statically.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_admin.v2alpha.ClusterStatus.success_rate_ejection_threshold:

success_rate_ejection_threshold
  (:ref:`type.Percent <envoy_api_msg_type.Percent>`) The success rate threshold used in the last interval.
  If
  :ref:`outlier_detection.split_external_local_origin_errors<envoy_api_field_cluster.OutlierDetection.split_external_local_origin_errors>`
  is *false*, all errors: externally and locally generated were used to calculate the threshold.
  If
  :ref:`outlier_detection.split_external_local_origin_errors<envoy_api_field_cluster.OutlierDetection.split_external_local_origin_errors>`
  is *true*, only externally generated errors were used to calculate the threshold.
  The threshold is used to eject hosts based on their success rate. See
  :ref:`Cluster outlier detection <arch_overview_outlier_detection>` documentation for details.
  
  Note: this field may be omitted in any of the three following cases:
  
  1. There were not enough hosts with enough request volume to proceed with success rate based
     outlier ejection.
  2. The threshold is computed to be < 0 because a negative value implies that there was no
     threshold for that interval.
  3. Outlier detection is not enabled for this cluster.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_admin.v2alpha.ClusterStatus.host_statuses:

host_statuses
  (:ref:`admin.v2alpha.HostStatus <envoy_api_msg_admin.v2alpha.HostStatus>`) Mapping from host address to the host's current status.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_admin.v2alpha.ClusterStatus.local_origin_success_rate_ejection_threshold:

local_origin_success_rate_ejection_threshold
  (:ref:`type.Percent <envoy_api_msg_type.Percent>`) The success rate threshold used in the last interval when only locally originated failures were
  taken into account and externally originated errors were treated as success.
  This field should be interpreted only when
  :ref:`outlier_detection.split_external_local_origin_errors<envoy_api_field_cluster.OutlierDetection.split_external_local_origin_errors>`
  is *true*. The threshold is used to eject hosts based on their success rate.
  See :ref:`Cluster outlier detection <arch_overview_outlier_detection>` documentation for
  details.
  
  Note: this field may be omitted in any of the three following cases:
  
  1. There were not enough hosts with enough request volume to proceed with success rate based
     outlier ejection.
  2. The threshold is computed to be < 0 because a negative value implies that there was no
     threshold for that interval.
