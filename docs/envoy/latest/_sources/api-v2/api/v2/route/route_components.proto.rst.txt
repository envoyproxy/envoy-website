`[route.VirtualHost proto] <https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/8b9f68848877502fd32fc85c281c442310963494/api/envoy/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#L37>`_

The top level element in the routing configuration is a virtual host. Each virtual host has
a logical name as well as a set of domains that get routed to it based on the incoming request's
host header. This allows a single listener to service multiple top level domain path trees. Once
a virtual host is selected based on the domain, the routes are processed in order to see which
upstream cluster to route to or whether to perform a redirect.

.. _envoy_api_field_route.VirtualHost.name:

name
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_, *REQUIRED*) The logical name of the virtual host. This is used when emitting certain
  statistics but is not relevant for routing.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.VirtualHost.domains:

domains
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_, *REQUIRED*) A list of domains (host/authority header) that will be matched to this
  virtual host. Wildcard hosts are supported in the suffix or prefix form.
  
  Domain search order:
   1. Exact domain names: ``www.foo.com``.
   2. Suffix domain wildcards: ``*.foo.com`` or ``*-bar.foo.com``.
   3. Prefix domain wildcards: ``foo.*`` or ``foo-*``.
   4. Special wildcard ``*`` matching any domain.
  
  .. note::
  
    The wildcard will not match the empty string.
    e.g. ``*-bar.foo.com`` will match ``baz-bar.foo.com`` but not ``-bar.foo.com``.
    The longest wildcards match first.
    Only a single virtual host in the entire route configuration can match on ``*``. A domain
    must be unique across all virtual hosts or the config will fail to load.
  
  Domains cannot contain control characters. This is validated by the well_known_regex HTTP_HEADER_VALUE.

  (`bool <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Decides whether the :ref:`x-envoy-attempt-count
  <config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-attempt-count>` header should be included
  in the upstream request. Setting this option will cause it to override any existing header
  value, so in the case of two Envoys on the request path with this option enabled, the upstream
  will see the attempt count as perceived by the second Envoy. Defaults to false.
  This header is unaffected by the

  <config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-attempt-count>` header should be included
  in the downstream response. Setting this option will cause the router to override any existing header
  value, so in the case of two Envoys on the request path with this option enabled, the downstream
  will see the attempt count as perceived by the Envoy closest upstream from itself. Defaults to false.
  This header is unaffected by the

  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) If specified, the route is a prefix rule meaning that the prefix must
  match the beginning of the *:path* header.
  
  
  
  Precisely one of :ref:`prefix <envoy_api_field_route.RouteMatch.prefix>`, :ref:`path <envoy_api_field_route.RouteMatch.path>`, :ref:`regex <envoy_api_field_route.RouteMatch.regex>`, :ref:`safe_regex <envoy_api_field_route.RouteMatch.safe_regex>` must be set.
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteMatch.path:

path
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) If specified, the route is an exact path rule meaning that the path must
  exactly match the *:path* header once the query string is removed.
  
  
  
  Precisely one of :ref:`prefix <envoy_api_field_route.RouteMatch.prefix>`, :ref:`path <envoy_api_field_route.RouteMatch.path>`, :ref:`regex <envoy_api_field_route.RouteMatch.regex>`, :ref:`safe_regex <envoy_api_field_route.RouteMatch.safe_regex>` must be set.
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteMatch.regex:

regex
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) If specified, the route is a regular expression rule meaning that the
  regex must match the *:path* header once the query string is removed. The entire path
  (without the query string) must match the regex. The rule will not match if only a
  subsequence of the *:path* header matches the regex. The regex grammar is defined `here
  <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex/ecmascript>`_.
  
  Examples:
  
  * The regex ``/b[io]t`` matches the path */bit*
  * The regex ``/b[io]t`` matches the path */bot*
  * The regex ``/b[io]t`` does not match the path */bite*
  * The regex ``/b[io]t`` does not match the path */bit/bot*
  
  .. attention::
    This field has been deprecated in favor of `safe_regex` as it is not safe for use with
    untrusted input in all cases.
  
  
  
  Precisely one of :ref:`prefix <envoy_api_field_route.RouteMatch.prefix>`, :ref:`path <envoy_api_field_route.RouteMatch.path>`, :ref:`regex <envoy_api_field_route.RouteMatch.regex>`, :ref:`safe_regex <envoy_api_field_route.RouteMatch.safe_regex>` must be set.
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteMatch.safe_regex:

safe_regex
  (:ref:`type.matcher.RegexMatcher <envoy_api_msg_type.matcher.RegexMatcher>`) If specified, the route is a regular expression rule meaning that the
  regex must match the *:path* header once the query string is removed. The entire path
  (without the query string) must match the regex. The rule will not match if only a
  subsequence of the *:path* header matches the regex.

.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteMatch.case_sensitive:

case_sensitive
  (`BoolValue <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#boolvalue>`_) Indicates that prefix/path matching should be case insensitive. The default
  is true.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteMatch.runtime_fraction:

runtime_fraction
  (:ref:`core.RuntimeFractionalPercent <envoy_api_msg_core.RuntimeFractionalPercent>`) Indicates that the route should additionally match on a runtime key. Every time the route
  is considered for a match, it must also fall under the percentage of matches indicated by
  this field. For some fraction N/D, a random number in the range [0,D) is selected. If the
  number is <= the value of the numerator N, or if the key is not present, the default
  value, the router continues to evaluate the remaining match criteria. A runtime_fraction
  route configuration can be used to roll out route changes in a gradual manner without full
  code/config deploys. Refer to the :ref:`traffic shifting
  <config_http_conn_man_route_table_traffic_splitting_shift>` docs for additional documentation.
  
  .. note::
  
     Parsing this field is implemented such that the runtime key's data may be represented
     as a FractionalPercent proto represented as JSON/YAML and may also be represented as an
     integer with the assumption that the value is an integral percentage out of 100. For
     instance, a runtime key lookup returning the value "42" would parse as a FractionalPercent
     whose numerator is 42 and denominator is HUNDRED. This preserves legacy semantics.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteMatch.headers:

headers
  (:ref:`route.HeaderMatcher <envoy_api_msg_route.HeaderMatcher>`) Specifies a set of headers that the route should match on. The router will
  check the request’s headers against all the specified headers in the route
  config. A match will happen if all the headers in the route are present in
  the request with the same values (or based on presence if the value field
  is not in the config).
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteMatch.query_parameters:

query_parameters
  (:ref:`route.QueryParameterMatcher <envoy_api_msg_route.QueryParameterMatcher>`) Specifies a set of URL query parameters on which the route should
  match. The router will check the query string from the *path* header
  against all the specified query parameters. If the number of specified
  query parameters is nonzero, they all must match the *path* header's
  query string for a match to occur.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteMatch.grpc:

grpc
  (:ref:`route.RouteMatch.GrpcRouteMatchOptions <envoy_api_msg_route.RouteMatch.GrpcRouteMatchOptions>`) If specified, only gRPC requests will be matched. The router will check
  that the content-type header has a application/grpc or one of the various
  application/grpc+ values.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteMatch.tls_context:

tls_context
  (:ref:`route.RouteMatch.TlsContextMatchOptions <envoy_api_msg_route.RouteMatch.TlsContextMatchOptions>`) If specified, the client tls context will be matched against the defined
  match options.

.. _envoy_api_field_route.CorsPolicy.enabled:

enabled
  (`BoolValue <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#boolvalue>`_) Specifies if the CORS filter is enabled. Defaults to true. Only effective on route.
  
  .. attention::
  
    **This field is deprecated**. Set the
    :ref:`filter_enabled<envoy_api_field_route.CorsPolicy.filter_enabled>` field instead.

.. _envoy_api_field_route.CorsPolicy.filter_enabled:

filter_enabled
  (:ref:`core.RuntimeFractionalPercent <envoy_api_msg_core.RuntimeFractionalPercent>`) Specifies the % of requests for which the CORS filter is enabled.
  
  If neither ``enabled``, ``filter_enabled``, nor ``shadow_enabled`` are specified, the CORS
  filter will be enabled for 100% of the requests.
  
  If :ref:`runtime_key <envoy_api_field_core.RuntimeFractionalPercent.runtime_key>` is
  specified, Envoy will lookup the runtime key to get the percentage of requests to filter.
  
  
  
  Only one of :ref:`enabled <envoy_api_field_route.CorsPolicy.enabled>`, :ref:`filter_enabled <envoy_api_field_route.CorsPolicy.filter_enabled>` may be set.
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.CorsPolicy.shadow_enabled:

shadow_enabled
  (:ref:`core.RuntimeFractionalPercent <envoy_api_msg_core.RuntimeFractionalPercent>`) Specifies the % of requests for which the CORS policies will be evaluated and tracked, but not
  enforced.
  
  This field is intended to be used when ``filter_enabled`` and ``enabled`` are off. One of those
  fields have to explicitly disable the filter in order for this setting to take effect.
  
  If :ref:`runtime_key <envoy_api_field_core.RuntimeFractionalPercent.runtime_key>` is specified,

.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.cluster:

cluster
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Indicates the upstream cluster to which the request should be routed
  to.
  
  
  
  Precisely one of :ref:`cluster <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.cluster>`, :ref:`cluster_header <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.cluster_header>`, :ref:`weighted_clusters <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.weighted_clusters>` must be set.
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.cluster_header:

cluster_header
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Envoy will determine the cluster to route to by reading the value of the
  HTTP header named by cluster_header from the request headers. If the
  header is not found or the referenced cluster does not exist, Envoy will
  return a 404 response.
  
  .. attention::
  
    Internally, Envoy always uses the HTTP/2 *:authority* header to represent the HTTP/1
    *Host* header. Thus, if attempting to match on *Host*, match on *:authority* instead.
  
  
  
  Precisely one of :ref:`cluster <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.cluster>`, :ref:`cluster_header <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.cluster_header>`, :ref:`weighted_clusters <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.weighted_clusters>` must be set.
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.weighted_clusters:

weighted_clusters
  (:ref:`route.WeightedCluster <envoy_api_msg_route.WeightedCluster>`) Multiple upstream clusters can be specified for a given route. The
  request is routed to one of the upstream clusters based on weights
  assigned to each cluster. See
  :ref:`traffic splitting <config_http_conn_man_route_table_traffic_splitting_split>`
  for additional documentation.
  
  
  
  Precisely one of :ref:`cluster <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.cluster>`, :ref:`cluster_header <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.cluster_header>`, :ref:`weighted_clusters <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.weighted_clusters>` must be set.
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.cluster_not_found_response_code:

cluster_not_found_response_code
  (:ref:`route.RouteAction.ClusterNotFoundResponseCode <envoy_api_enum_route.RouteAction.ClusterNotFoundResponseCode>`) The HTTP status code to use when configured cluster is not found.
  The default response code is 503 Service Unavailable.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.metadata_match:

metadata_match
  (:ref:`core.Metadata <envoy_api_msg_core.Metadata>`) Optional endpoint metadata match criteria used by the subset load balancer. Only endpoints
  in the upstream cluster with metadata matching what's set in this field will be considered
  for load balancing. If using :ref:`weighted_clusters
  <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.weighted_clusters>`, metadata will be merged, with values
  provided there taking precedence. The filter name should be specified as *envoy.lb*.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.prefix_rewrite:

prefix_rewrite
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Indicates that during forwarding, the matched prefix (or path) should be
  swapped with this value. This option allows application URLs to be rooted
  at a different path from those exposed at the reverse proxy layer. The router filter will
  place the original path before rewrite into the :ref:`x-envoy-original-path
  <config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-original-path>` header.
  
  Only one of *prefix_rewrite* or
  :ref:`regex_rewrite <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.regex_rewrite>`
  may be specified.
  
  .. attention::
  
    Pay careful attention to the use of trailing slashes in the
    :ref:`route's match <envoy_api_field_route.Route.match>` prefix value.
    Stripping a prefix from a path requires multiple Routes to handle all cases. For example,
    rewriting */prefix* to */* and */prefix/etc* to */etc* cannot be done in a single
    :ref:`Route <envoy_api_msg_route.Route>`, as shown by the below config entries:
  
    .. code-block:: yaml
  
      - match:
          prefix: "/prefix/"
        route:
          prefix_rewrite: "/"
      - match:
          prefix: "/prefix"
        route:
          prefix_rewrite: "/"
  
    Having above entries in the config, requests to */prefix* will be stripped to */*, while
    requests to */prefix/etc* will be stripped to */etc*.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.regex_rewrite:

regex_rewrite
  (:ref:`type.matcher.RegexMatchAndSubstitute <envoy_api_msg_type.matcher.RegexMatchAndSubstitute>`) Indicates that during forwarding, portions of the path that match the
  pattern should be rewritten, even allowing the substitution of capture
  groups from the pattern into the new path as specified by the rewrite
  substitution string. This is useful to allow application paths to be
  rewritten in a way that is aware of segments with variable content like
  identifiers. The router filter will place the original path as it was
  before the rewrite into the :ref:`x-envoy-original-path
  <config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-original-path>` header.
  
  Only one of :ref:`prefix_rewrite <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.prefix_rewrite>`
  or *regex_rewrite* may be specified.
  
  Examples using Google's `RE2 <https://github.com/google/re2>`_ engine:
  
  * The path pattern ``^/service/([^/]+)(/.*)$`` paired with a substitution
    string of ``\2/instance/\1`` would transform ``/service/foo/v1/api``
    into ``/v1/api/instance/foo``.
  
  * The pattern ``one`` paired with a substitution string of ``two`` would
    transform ``/xxx/one/yyy/one/zzz`` into ``/xxx/two/yyy/two/zzz``.
  
  * The pattern ``^(.*?)one(.*)$`` paired with a substitution string of
    ``\1two\2`` would replace only the first occurrence of ``one``,
    transforming path ``/xxx/one/yyy/one/zzz`` into ``/xxx/two/yyy/one/zzz``.
  
  * The pattern ``(?i)/xxx/`` paired with a substitution string of ``/yyy/``
    would do a case-insensitive match and transform path ``/aaa/XxX/bbb`` to
    ``/aaa/yyy/bbb``.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.host_rewrite:

host_rewrite
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Indicates that during forwarding, the host header will be swapped with
  this value.
  
  
  
  Only one of :ref:`host_rewrite <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.host_rewrite>`, :ref:`auto_host_rewrite <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.auto_host_rewrite>`, :ref:`auto_host_rewrite_header <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.auto_host_rewrite_header>` may be set.
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.auto_host_rewrite:

auto_host_rewrite
  (`BoolValue <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#boolvalue>`_) Indicates that during forwarding, the host header will be swapped with
  the hostname of the upstream host chosen by the cluster manager. This
  option is applicable only when the destination cluster for a route is of
  type *strict_dns* or *logical_dns*. Setting this to true with other cluster
  types has no effect.
  
  
  
  Only one of :ref:`host_rewrite <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.host_rewrite>`, :ref:`auto_host_rewrite <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.auto_host_rewrite>`, :ref:`auto_host_rewrite_header <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.auto_host_rewrite_header>` may be set.
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.auto_host_rewrite_header:

auto_host_rewrite_header
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Indicates that during forwarding, the host header will be swapped with the content of given
  downstream or :ref:`custom <config_http_conn_man_headers_custom_request_headers>` header.
  If header value is empty, host header is left intact.
  
  .. attention::
  
    Pay attention to the potential security implications of using this option. Provided header
    must come from trusted source.
  
  
  
  Only one of :ref:`host_rewrite <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.host_rewrite>`, :ref:`auto_host_rewrite <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.auto_host_rewrite>`, :ref:`auto_host_rewrite_header <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.auto_host_rewrite_header>` may be set.
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.timeout:

timeout
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) Specifies the upstream timeout for the route. If not specified, the default is 15s. This
  spans between the point at which the entire downstream request (i.e. end-of-stream) has been
  processed and when the upstream response has been completely processed. A value of 0 will
  disable the route's timeout.
  
  .. note::
  
    This timeout includes all retries. See also
    :ref:`config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-upstream-rq-timeout-ms`,
    :ref:`config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-upstream-rq-per-try-timeout-ms`, and the
    :ref:`retry overview <arch_overview_http_routing_retry>`.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.idle_timeout:

idle_timeout
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) Specifies the idle timeout for the route. If not specified, there is no per-route idle timeout,
  although the connection manager wide :ref:`stream_idle_timeout
  <envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.stream_idle_timeout>`
  will still apply. A value of 0 will completely disable the route's idle timeout, even if a
  connection manager stream idle timeout is configured.
  
  The idle timeout is distinct to :ref:`timeout
  <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.timeout>`, which provides an upper bound
  on the upstream response time; :ref:`idle_timeout
  <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.idle_timeout>` instead bounds the amount
  of time the request's stream may be idle.
  
  After header decoding, the idle timeout will apply on downstream and
  upstream request events. Each time an encode/decode event for headers or
  data is processed for the stream, the timer will be reset. If the timeout
  fires, the stream is terminated with a 408 Request Timeout error code if no
  upstream response header has been received, otherwise a stream reset
  occurs.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.retry_policy:

retry_policy
  (:ref:`route.RetryPolicy <envoy_api_msg_route.RetryPolicy>`) Indicates that the route has a retry policy. Note that if this is set,
  it'll take precedence over the virtual host level retry policy entirely
  (e.g.: policies are not merged, most internal one becomes the enforced policy).
  
  

.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.request_mirror_policy:

request_mirror_policy
  (:ref:`route.RouteAction.RequestMirrorPolicy <envoy_api_msg_route.RouteAction.RequestMirrorPolicy>`) Indicates that the route has a request mirroring policy.
  
  .. attention::
    This field has been deprecated in favor of `request_mirror_policies` which supports one or
    more mirroring policies.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.request_mirror_policies:

request_mirror_policies
  (:ref:`route.RouteAction.RequestMirrorPolicy <envoy_api_msg_route.RouteAction.RequestMirrorPolicy>`) Indicates that the route has request mirroring policies.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.priority:

priority
  (:ref:`core.RoutingPriority <envoy_api_enum_core.RoutingPriority>`) Optionally specifies the :ref:`routing priority <arch_overview_http_routing_priority>`.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.rate_limits:

rate_limits
  (:ref:`route.RateLimit <envoy_api_msg_route.RateLimit>`) Specifies a set of rate limit configurations that could be applied to the
  route.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.include_vh_rate_limits:

include_vh_rate_limits
  (`BoolValue <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#boolvalue>`_) Specifies if the rate limit filter should include the virtual host rate
  limits. By default, if the route configured rate limits, the virtual host
  :ref:`rate_limits <envoy_api_field_route.VirtualHost.rate_limits>` are not applied to the
  request.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.hash_policy:

hash_policy
  (:ref:`route.RouteAction.HashPolicy <envoy_api_msg_route.RouteAction.HashPolicy>`) Specifies a list of hash policies to use for ring hash load balancing. Each
  hash policy is evaluated individually and the combined result is used to
  route the request. The method of combination is deterministic such that
  identical lists of hash policies will produce the same hash. Since a hash
  policy examines specific parts of a request, it can fail to produce a hash
  (i.e. if the hashed header is not present). If (and only if) all configured
  hash policies fail to generate a hash, no hash will be produced for
  the route. In this case, the behavior is the same as if no hash policies
  were specified (i.e. the ring hash load balancer will choose a random
  backend). If a hash policy has the "terminal" attribute set to true, and
  there is already a hash generated, the hash is returned immediately,
  ignoring the rest of the hash policy list.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.cors:

cors
  (:ref:`route.CorsPolicy <envoy_api_msg_route.CorsPolicy>`) Indicates that the route has a CORS policy.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.max_grpc_timeout:

max_grpc_timeout
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) If present, and the request is a gRPC request, use the
  `grpc-timeout header <https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md>`_,
  or its default value (infinity) instead of
  :ref:`timeout <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.timeout>`, but limit the applied timeout
  to the maximum value specified here. If configured as 0, the maximum allowed timeout for
  gRPC requests is infinity. If not configured at all, the `grpc-timeout` header is not used
  and gRPC requests time out like any other requests using
  :ref:`timeout <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.timeout>` or its default.
  This can be used to prevent unexpected upstream request timeouts due to potentially long
  time gaps between gRPC request and response in gRPC streaming mode.
  
  .. note::
  
     If a timeout is specified using :ref:`config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-upstream-rq-timeout-ms`, it takes
     precedence over `grpc-timeout header <https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/doc/PROTOCOL-HTTP2.md>`_, when
     both are present. See also
     :ref:`config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-upstream-rq-timeout-ms`,
     :ref:`config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-upstream-rq-per-try-timeout-ms`, and the
     :ref:`retry overview <arch_overview_http_routing_retry>`.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.grpc_timeout_offset:

grpc_timeout_offset
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) If present, Envoy will adjust the timeout provided by the `grpc-timeout` header by subtracting
  the provided duration from the header. This is useful in allowing Envoy to set its global
  timeout to be less than that of the deadline imposed by the calling client, which makes it more
  likely that Envoy will handle the timeout instead of having the call canceled by the client.
  The offset will only be applied if the provided grpc_timeout is greater than the offset. This
  ensures that the offset will only ever decrease the timeout and never set it to 0 (meaning
  infinity).
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.upgrade_configs:

upgrade_configs
  (:ref:`route.RouteAction.UpgradeConfig <envoy_api_msg_route.RouteAction.UpgradeConfig>`) 
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.internal_redirect_action:

internal_redirect_action
  (:ref:`route.RouteAction.InternalRedirectAction <envoy_api_enum_route.RouteAction.InternalRedirectAction>`) 
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.max_internal_redirects:

max_internal_redirects
  (`UInt32Value <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#uint32value>`_) An internal redirect is handled, iff the number of previous internal redirects that a
  downstream request has encountered is lower than this value, and
  :ref:`internal_redirect_action <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.internal_redirect_action>`
  is set to :ref:`HANDLE_INTERNAL_REDIRECT
  <envoy_api_enum_value_route.RouteAction.InternalRedirectAction.HANDLE_INTERNAL_REDIRECT>`
  In the case where a downstream request is bounced among multiple routes by internal redirect,
  the first route that hits this threshold, or has
  :ref:`internal_redirect_action <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.internal_redirect_action>`
  set to
  :ref:`PASS_THROUGH_INTERNAL_REDIRECT
  <envoy_api_enum_value_route.RouteAction.InternalRedirectAction.PASS_THROUGH_INTERNAL_REDIRECT>`
  will pass the redirect back to downstream.
  
  If not specified, at most one redirect will be followed.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.hedge_policy:

hedge_policy
  (:ref:`route.HedgePolicy <envoy_api_msg_route.HedgePolicy>`) Indicates that the route has a hedge policy. Note that if this is set,
  it'll take precedence over the virtual host level hedge policy entirely
  (e.g.: policies are not merged, most internal one becomes the enforced policy).
  
  
.. _envoy_api_msg_route.RouteAction.RequestMirrorPolicy:

route.RouteAction.RequestMirrorPolicy
-------------------------------------

`[route.RouteAction.RequestMirrorPolicy proto] <https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/8b9f68848877502fd32fc85c281c442310963494/api/envoy/api/v2/route/route_components.proto#L585>`_

The router is capable of shadowing traffic from one cluster to another. The current
implementation is "fire and forget," meaning Envoy will not wait for the shadow cluster to
respond before returning the response from the primary cluster. All normal statistics are
collected for the shadow cluster making this feature useful for testing.

During shadowing, the host/authority header is altered such that *-shadow* is appended. This is
useful for logging. For example, *cluster1* becomes *cluster1-shadow*.

.. note::

  Shadowing will not be triggered if the primary cluster does not exist.

.. code-block:: json

.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.RequestMirrorPolicy.cluster:

cluster
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_, *REQUIRED*) Specifies the cluster that requests will be mirrored to. The cluster must
  exist in the cluster manager configuration.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.RequestMirrorPolicy.runtime_key:

runtime_key
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) If not specified, all requests to the target cluster will be mirrored. If
  specified, Envoy will lookup the runtime key to get the % of requests to
  mirror. Valid values are from 0 to 10000, allowing for increments of
  0.01% of requests to be mirrored. If the runtime key is specified in the
  configuration but not present in runtime, 0 is the default and thus 0% of
  requests will be mirrored.
  
  .. attention::
  
    **This field is deprecated**. Set the
    :ref:`runtime_fraction
    <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.RequestMirrorPolicy.runtime_fraction>`
    field instead. Mirroring occurs if both this and
    <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.RequestMirrorPolicy.runtime_fraction>`
    are not set.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.RequestMirrorPolicy.runtime_fraction:

runtime_fraction
  (:ref:`core.RuntimeFractionalPercent <envoy_api_msg_core.RuntimeFractionalPercent>`) If not specified, all requests to the target cluster will be mirrored.
  
  If specified, this field takes precedence over the `runtime_key` field and requests must also
  fall under the percentage of matches indicated by this field.
  
  For some fraction N/D, a random number in the range [0,D) is selected. If the
  number is <= the value of the numerator N, or if the key is not present, the default
  value, the request will be mirrored.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.RequestMirrorPolicy.trace_sampled:

trace_sampled
  (`BoolValue <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#boolvalue>`_) Determines if the trace span should be sampled. Defaults to true.

.. _envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.HashPolicy.terminal:

terminal
  (`bool <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) The flag that short-circuits the hash computing. This field provides a
  'fallback' style of configuration: "if a terminal policy doesn't work,
  fallback to rest of the policy list", it saves time when the terminal
  policy works.
  
  If true, and there is already a hash computed, ignore rest of the
  list of hash polices.
  For example, if the following hash methods are configured:
  
   ========= ========
   specifier terminal
   ========= ========
   Header A  true
   Header B  false
   Header C  false
   ========= ========
  
  The generateHash process ends if policy "header A" generates a hash, as
  it's a terminal policy.

Envoy supports two types of cookie affinity:

1. Passive. Envoy takes a cookie that's present in the cookies header and
   hashes on its value.

2. Generated. Envoy generates and sets a cookie with an expiration (TTL)
   on the first request from the client in its response to the client,
   based on the endpoint the request gets sent to. The client then
   presents this on the next and all subsequent requests. The hash of
   this is sufficient to ensure these requests get sent to the same
   endpoint. The cookie is generated by hashing the source and
   destination ports and addresses so that multiple independent HTTP2
   streams on the same connection will independently receive the same
   cookie, even if they arrive at the Envoy simultaneously.

.. _envoy_api_field_route.RetryPolicy.retry_on:

retry_on
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Specifies the conditions under which retry takes place. These are the same
  conditions documented for :ref:`config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-retry-on` and
  :ref:`config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-retry-grpc-on`.

num_retries
  (`UInt32Value <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#uint32value>`_) Specifies the allowed number of retries. This parameter is optional and
  defaults to 1. These are the same conditions documented for
  :ref:`config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-max-retries`.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RetryPolicy.per_try_timeout:

per_try_timeout
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) Specifies a non-zero upstream timeout per retry attempt. This parameter is optional. The
  same conditions documented for
  :ref:`config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-upstream-rq-per-try-timeout-ms` apply.
  
  .. note::
  
    If left unspecified, Envoy will use the global
    :ref:`route timeout <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.timeout>` for the request.
    Consequently, when using a :ref:`5xx <config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-retry-on>` based
    retry policy, a request that times out will not be retried as the total timeout budget
    would have been exhausted.

retry_priority
  (:ref:`route.RetryPolicy.RetryPriority <envoy_api_msg_route.RetryPolicy.RetryPriority>`) Specifies an implementation of a RetryPriority which is used to determine the

  :ref:`retry plugin configuration <arch_overview_http_retry_plugins>` for more details.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RetryPolicy.retry_host_predicate:

retry_host_predicate
  (:ref:`route.RetryPolicy.RetryHostPredicate <envoy_api_msg_route.RetryPolicy.RetryHostPredicate>`) Specifies a collection of RetryHostPredicates that will be consulted when selecting a host
  for retries. If any of the predicates reject the host, host selection will be reattempted.

  details.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RetryPolicy.host_selection_retry_max_attempts:

host_selection_retry_max_attempts
  (`int64 <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) The maximum number of times host selection will be reattempted before giving up, at which
  point the host that was last selected will be routed to. If unspecified, this will default to
  retrying once.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RetryPolicy.retriable_status_codes:

retriable_status_codes
  (`uint32 <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) HTTP status codes that should trigger a retry in addition to those specified by retry_on.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RetryPolicy.retry_back_off:

retry_back_off
  (:ref:`route.RetryPolicy.RetryBackOff <envoy_api_msg_route.RetryPolicy.RetryBackOff>`) Specifies parameters that control retry back off. This parameter is optional, in which case the
  default base interval is 25 milliseconds or, if set, the current value of the
  `upstream.base_retry_backoff_ms` runtime parameter. The default maximum interval is 10 times
  the base interval. The documentation for :ref:`config_http_filters_router_x-envoy-max-retries`
  describes Envoy's back-off algorithm.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RetryPolicy.retriable_headers:

retriable_headers
  (:ref:`route.HeaderMatcher <envoy_api_msg_route.HeaderMatcher>`) HTTP response headers that trigger a retry if present in the response. A retry will be
  triggered if any of the header matches match the upstream response headers.
  The field is only consulted if 'retriable-headers' retry policy is active.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_route.RetryPolicy.retriable_request_headers:

retriable_request_headers
  (:ref:`route.HeaderMatcher <envoy_api_msg_route.HeaderMatcher>`) HTTP headers which must be present in the request for retries to be attempted.

A virtual cluster is a way of specifying a regex matching rule against
certain important endpoints such that statistics are generated explicitly for
the matched requests. The reason this is useful is that when doing
prefix/path matching Envoy does not always know what the application
considers to be an endpoint. Thus, it’s impossible for Envoy to generically
emit per endpoint statistics. However, often systems have highly critical
endpoints that they wish to get “perfect” statistics on. Virtual cluster
statistics are perfect in the sense that they are emitted on the downstream
side such that they include network level failures.

Documentation for :ref:`virtual cluster statistics <config_http_filters_router_vcluster_stats>`.

.. note::

   Virtual clusters are a useful tool, but we do not recommend setting up a virtual cluster for
   every application endpoint. This is both not easily maintainable and as well the matching and
   statistics output are not free.

pattern
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Specifies a regex pattern to use for matching requests. The entire path of the request
  must match the regex. The regex grammar used is defined `here
  <https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/regex/ecmascript>`_.
  
  Examples:
  
  * The regex ``/rides/\d+`` matches the path */rides/0*
  * The regex ``/rides/\d+`` matches the path */rides/123*
  * The regex ``/rides/\d+`` does not match the path */rides/123/456*

.. attention::

  Internally, Envoy always uses the HTTP/2 *:authority* header to represent the HTTP/1 *Host*
  header. Thus, if attempting to match on *Host*, match on *:authority* instead.

.. attention::

  To route on HTTP method, use the special HTTP/2 *:method* header. This works for both
  HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 as Envoy normalizes headers. E.g.,

  .. code-block:: json

    {
      "name": ":method",
      "exact_match": "POST"
    }

.. attention::
  In the absence of any header match specifier, match will default to :ref:`present_match
  <envoy_api_field_route.HeaderMatcher.present_match>`. i.e, a request that has the :ref:`name
  <envoy_api_field_route.HeaderMatcher.name>` header will match, regardless of the header's
  value.

.. _envoy_api_field_route.HeaderMatcher.range_match:

range_match
  (:ref:`type.Int64Range <envoy_api_msg_type.Int64Range>`) If specified, header match will be performed based on range.
  The rule will match if the request header value is within this range.
  The entire request header value must represent an integer in base 10 notation: consisting of
  an optional plus or minus sign followed by a sequence of digits. The rule will not match if
  the header value does not represent an integer. Match will fail for empty values, floating
  point numbers or if only a subsequence of the header value is an integer.

.. _envoy_api_field_route.HeaderMatcher.prefix_match:

prefix_match
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) If specified, header match will be performed based on the prefix of the header value.

.. _envoy_api_field_route.HeaderMatcher.invert_match:

invert_match
  (`bool <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) If specified, the match result will be inverted before checking. Defaults to false.
  
  Examples:
  
  * The regex ``\d{3}`` does not match the value *1234*, so it will match when inverted.
  * The range [-10,0) will match the value -1, so it will not match when inverted.
