Protocol options
================



.. _envoy_api_msg_core.HttpProtocolOptions:

core.HttpProtocolOptions
------------------------

`[core.HttpProtocolOptions proto] <https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/d7392c89250c4e8069614bdaa7f0f6ef48efc0f6/api/envoy/api/v2/core/protocol.proto#L21>`_


.. code-block:: json

  {
    "idle_timeout": "{...}"
  }

.. _envoy_api_field_core.HttpProtocolOptions.idle_timeout:

idle_timeout
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) The idle timeout for upstream connection pool connections. The idle timeout is defined as the
  period in which there are no active requests. If not set, there is no idle timeout. When the
  idle timeout is reached the connection will be closed. Note that request based timeouts mean
  that HTTP/2 PINGs will not keep the connection alive.
  
  


.. _envoy_api_msg_core.Http1ProtocolOptions:

core.Http1ProtocolOptions
-------------------------

`[core.Http1ProtocolOptions proto] <https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/d7392c89250c4e8069614bdaa7f0f6ef48efc0f6/api/envoy/api/v2/core/protocol.proto#L29>`_


.. code-block:: json

  {
    "allow_absolute_url": "{...}",
    "accept_http_10": "...",
    "default_host_for_http_10": "..."
  }

.. _envoy_api_field_core.Http1ProtocolOptions.allow_absolute_url:

allow_absolute_url
  (`BoolValue <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#boolvalue>`_) Handle HTTP requests with absolute URLs in the requests. These requests
  are generally sent by clients to forward/explicit proxies. This allows clients to configure
  envoy as their HTTP proxy. In Unix, for example, this is typically done by setting the
  *http_proxy* environment variable.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_core.Http1ProtocolOptions.accept_http_10:

accept_http_10
  (`bool <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Handle incoming HTTP/1.0 and HTTP 0.9 requests.
  This is off by default, and not fully standards compliant. There is support for pre-HTTP/1.1
  style connect logic, dechunking, and handling lack of client host iff
  *default_host_for_http_10* is configured.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_core.Http1ProtocolOptions.default_host_for_http_10:

default_host_for_http_10
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) A default host for HTTP/1.0 requests. This is highly suggested if *accept_http_10* is true as
  Envoy does not otherwise support HTTP/1.0 without a Host header.
  This is a no-op if *accept_http_10* is not true.
  
  


.. _envoy_api_msg_core.Http2ProtocolOptions:

core.Http2ProtocolOptions
-------------------------

`[core.Http2ProtocolOptions proto] <https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/d7392c89250c4e8069614bdaa7f0f6ef48efc0f6/api/envoy/api/v2/core/protocol.proto#L49>`_


.. code-block:: json

  {
    "hpack_table_size": "{...}",
    "max_concurrent_streams": "{...}",
    "initial_stream_window_size": "{...}",
    "initial_connection_window_size": "{...}",
    "allow_connect": "...",
    "max_outbound_frames": "{...}",
    "max_outbound_control_frames": "{...}",
    "max_consecutive_inbound_frames_with_empty_payload": "{...}",
    "max_inbound_priority_frames_per_stream": "{...}",
    "max_inbound_window_update_frames_per_data_frame_sent": "{...}",
    "stream_error_on_invalid_http_messaging": "..."
  }

.. _envoy_api_field_core.Http2ProtocolOptions.hpack_table_size:

hpack_table_size
  (`UInt32Value <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#uint32value>`_) `Maximum table size <https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7541.html#rfc.section.4.2>`_
  (in octets) that the encoder is permitted to use for the dynamic HPACK table. Valid values
  range from 0 to 4294967295 (2^32 - 1) and defaults to 4096. 0 effectively disables header
  compression.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_core.Http2ProtocolOptions.max_concurrent_streams:

max_concurrent_streams
  (`UInt32Value <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#uint32value>`_) `Maximum concurrent streams <https://httpwg.org/specs/rfc7540.html#rfc.section.5.1.2>`_
  allowed for peer on one HTTP/2 connection. Valid values range from 1 to 2147483647 (2^31 - 1)
  and defaults to 2147483647.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_core.Http2ProtocolOptions.initial_stream_window_size:

initial_stream_window_size
  (`UInt32Value <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#uint32value>`_) This field also acts as a soft limit on the number of bytes Envoy will buffer per-stream in the
  HTTP/2 codec buffers. Once the buffer reaches this pointer, watermark callbacks will fire to
  stop the flow of data to the codec buffers.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_core.Http2ProtocolOptions.initial_connection_window_size:

initial_connection_window_size
  (`UInt32Value <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#uint32value>`_) Similar to *initial_stream_window_size*, but for connection-level flow-control
  window. Currently, this has the same minimum/maximum/default as *initial_stream_window_size*.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_core.Http2ProtocolOptions.allow_connect:

allow_connect
  (`bool <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Allows proxying Websocket and other upgrades over H2 connect.
  
  

.. _envoy_api_field_core.Http2ProtocolOptions.max_outbound_frames:

max_outbound_frames
  (`UInt32Value <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#uint32value>`_) Limit the number of pending outbound downstream frames of all types (frames that are waiting to
  be written into the socket). Exceeding this limit triggers flood mitigation and connection is
  terminated. The ``http2.outbound_flood`` stat tracks the number of terminated connections due
  to flood mitigation. The default limit is 10000.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_core.Http2ProtocolOptions.max_outbound_control_frames:

max_outbound_control_frames
  (`UInt32Value <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#uint32value>`_) Limit the number of pending outbound downstream frames of types PING, SETTINGS and RST_STREAM,
  preventing high memory utilization when receiving continuous stream of these frames. Exceeding
  this limit triggers flood mitigation and connection is terminated. The
  ``http2.outbound_control_flood`` stat tracks the number of terminated connections due to flood
  mitigation. The default limit is 1000.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_core.Http2ProtocolOptions.max_consecutive_inbound_frames_with_empty_payload:

max_consecutive_inbound_frames_with_empty_payload
  (`UInt32Value <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#uint32value>`_) Limit the number of consecutive inbound frames of types HEADERS, CONTINUATION and DATA with an
  empty payload and no end stream flag. Those frames have no legitimate use and are abusive, but
  might be a result of a broken HTTP/2 implementation. The `http2.inbound_empty_frames_flood``
  stat tracks the number of connections terminated due to flood mitigation.
  Setting this to 0 will terminate connection upon receiving first frame with an empty payload
  and no end stream flag. The default limit is 1.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_core.Http2ProtocolOptions.max_inbound_priority_frames_per_stream:

max_inbound_priority_frames_per_stream
  (`UInt32Value <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#uint32value>`_) Limit the number of inbound PRIORITY frames allowed per each opened stream. If the number
  of PRIORITY frames received over the lifetime of connection exceeds the value calculated
  using this formula::
  
      max_inbound_priority_frames_per_stream * (1 + inbound_streams)
  
  the connection is terminated. The ``http2.inbound_priority_frames_flood`` stat tracks
  the number of connections terminated due to flood mitigation. The default limit is 100.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_core.Http2ProtocolOptions.max_inbound_window_update_frames_per_data_frame_sent:

max_inbound_window_update_frames_per_data_frame_sent
  (`UInt32Value <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#uint32value>`_) Limit the number of inbound WINDOW_UPDATE frames allowed per DATA frame sent. If the number
  of WINDOW_UPDATE frames received over the lifetime of connection exceeds the value calculated
  using this formula::
  
      1 + 2 * (inbound_streams +
               max_inbound_window_update_frames_per_data_frame_sent * outbound_data_frames)
  
  the connection is terminated. The ``http2.inbound_priority_frames_flood`` stat tracks
  the number of connections terminated due to flood mitigation. The default limit is 10.
  Setting this to 1 should be enough to support HTTP/2 implementations with basic flow control,
  but more complex implementations that try to estimate available bandwidth require at least 2.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_core.Http2ProtocolOptions.stream_error_on_invalid_http_messaging:

stream_error_on_invalid_http_messaging
  (`bool <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Allows invalid HTTP messaging and headers. When this option is disabled (default), then
  the whole HTTP/2 connection is terminated upon receiving invalid HEADERS frame. However,
  when this option is enabled, only the offending stream is terminated.
  
  See [RFC7540, sec. 8.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540#section-8.1) for details.
