initial_jitter
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) An optional jitter amount in milliseconds. If specified, Envoy will start health
  checking after for a random time in ms between 0 and initial_jitter. This only
  applies to the first health check.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_core.HealthCheck.interval_jitter:

interval_jitter
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) An optional jitter amount in milliseconds. If specified, during every

  (`uint32 <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) An optional jitter amount as a percentage of interval_ms. If specified,
  during every interval Envoy will add interval_ms *
  interval_jitter_percent / 100 to the wait time.
  
  If interval_jitter_ms and interval_jitter_percent are both set, both of
  them will be used to increase the wait time.

no_traffic_interval
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) The "no traffic interval" is a special health check interval that is used when a cluster has
  never had traffic routed to it. This lower interval allows cluster information to be kept up to
  date, without sending a potentially large amount of active health checking traffic for no
  reason. Once a cluster has been used for traffic routing, Envoy will shift back to using the
  standard health check interval that is defined. Note that this interval takes precedence over
  any other.
  
  The default value for "no traffic interval" is 60 seconds.

  health check right after a host is marked as unhealthy. For subsequent health checks
  Envoy will shift back to using either "unhealthy interval" if present or the standard health
  check interval that is defined.
  
  The default value for "unhealthy edge interval" is the same as "unhealthy interval".
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_core.HealthCheck.healthy_edge_interval:

healthy_edge_interval
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) The "healthy edge interval" is a special health check interval that is used for the first
  health check right after a host is marked as healthy. For subsequent health checks
  Envoy will shift back to using the standard health check interval that is defined.
  
  The default value for "healthy edge interval" is the same as the default interval.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_core.HealthCheck.event_log_path:

event_log_path
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Specifies the path to the :ref:`health check event log <arch_overview_health_check_logging>`.

  Deprecated, use :ref:`codec_client_type
  <envoy_api_field_core.HealthCheck.HttpHealthCheck.codec_client_type>` instead.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_core.HealthCheck.HttpHealthCheck.expected_statuses:

expected_statuses
  (**repeated** :ref:`type.Int64Range <envoy_api_msg_type.Int64Range>`) Specifies a list of HTTP response statuses considered healthy. If provided, replaces default
  200-only policy - 200 must be included explicitly as needed. Ranges follow half-open
  semantics of :ref:`Int64Range <envoy_api_msg_type.Int64Range>`. The start and end of each
  range are required. Only statuses in the range [100, 600) are allowed.

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "send": "{...}",
    "receive": []
  }

  by setting the specified key to any value and waiting for traffic to drain.
  
  


.. _envoy_api_msg_core.HealthCheck.GrpcHealthCheck:

core.HealthCheck.GrpcHealthCheck
--------------------------------
