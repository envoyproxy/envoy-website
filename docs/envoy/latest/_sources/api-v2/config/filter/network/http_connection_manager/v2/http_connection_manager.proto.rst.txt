.. _envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.server_name:

server_name
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) An optional override that the connection manager will write to the server
  header in responses. If not set, the default is *envoy*.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.server_header_transformation:

server_header_transformation
  (:ref:`config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.ServerHeaderTransformation <envoy_api_enum_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.ServerHeaderTransformation>`) Defines the action to be applied to the Server header on the response path.
  By default, Envoy will overwrite the header with the value specified in
  server_name.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.max_request_headers_kb:

max_request_headers_kb
  (`UInt32Value <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#uint32value>`_) The maximum request headers size for incoming connections.
  If unconfigured, the default max request headers allowed is 60 KiB.
  Requests that exceed this limit will receive a 431 response.
  The max configurable limit is 96 KiB, based on current implementation
  constraints.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.idle_timeout:

idle_timeout
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) The idle timeout for connections managed by the connection manager. The
  idle timeout is defined as the period in which there are no active
  requests. If not set, there is no idle timeout. When the idle timeout is
  reached the connection will be closed. If the connection is an HTTP/2
  connection a drain sequence will occur prior to closing the connection.
  This field is deprecated. Use :ref:`idle_timeout
  <envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.common_http_protocol_options>`
  instead.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.stream_idle_timeout:

stream_idle_timeout
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) The stream idle timeout for connections managed by the connection manager.
  If not specified, this defaults to 5 minutes. The default value was selected
  so as not to interfere with any smaller configured timeouts that may have
  existed in configurations prior to the introduction of this feature, while
  introducing robustness to TCP connections that terminate without a FIN.
  
  This idle timeout applies to new streams and is overridable by the
  :ref:`route-level idle_timeout
  <envoy_api_field_route.RouteAction.idle_timeout>`. Even on a stream in
  which the override applies, prior to receipt of the initial request
  headers, the :ref:`stream_idle_timeout
  <envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.stream_idle_timeout>`
  applies. Each time an encode/decode event for headers or data is processed
  for the stream, the timer will be reset. If the timeout fires, the stream
  is terminated with a 408 Request Timeout error code if no upstream response
  header has been received, otherwise a stream reset occurs.
  
  Note that it is possible to idle timeout even if the wire traffic for a stream is non-idle, due
  to the granularity of events presented to the connection manager. For example, while receiving
  very large request headers, it may be the case that there is traffic regularly arriving on the
  wire while the connection manage is only able to observe the end-of-headers event, hence the
  stream may still idle timeout.
  
  A value of 0 will completely disable the connection manager stream idle
  timeout, although per-route idle timeout overrides will continue to apply.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.request_timeout:

request_timeout
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) The amount of time that Envoy will wait for the entire request to be received.
  The timer is activated when the request is initiated, and is disarmed when the last byte of the
  request is sent upstream (i.e. all decoding filters have processed the request), OR when the
  response is initiated. If not specified or set to 0, this timeout is disabled.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.drain_timeout:

drain_timeout
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) The time that Envoy will wait between sending an HTTP/2 “shutdown
  notification” (GOAWAY frame with max stream ID) and a final GOAWAY frame.
  This is used so that Envoy provides a grace period for new streams that
  race with the final GOAWAY frame. During this grace period, Envoy will
  continue to accept new streams. After the grace period, a final GOAWAY
  frame is sent and Envoy will start refusing new streams. Draining occurs
  both when a connection hits the idle timeout or during general server
  draining. The default grace period is 5000 milliseconds (5 seconds) if this
  option is not specified.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.delayed_close_timeout:

delayed_close_timeout
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) The delayed close timeout is for downstream connections managed by the HTTP connection manager.
  It is defined as a grace period after connection close processing has been locally initiated
  during which Envoy will wait for the peer to close (i.e., a TCP FIN/RST is received by Envoy
  from the downstream connection) prior to Envoy closing the socket associated with that
  connection.
  NOTE: This timeout is enforced even when the socket associated with the downstream connection
  is pending a flush of the write buffer. However, any progress made writing data to the socket
  will restart the timer associated with this timeout. This means that the total grace period for
  a socket in this state will be
  <total_time_waiting_for_write_buffer_flushes>+<delayed_close_timeout>.
  
  Delaying Envoy's connection close and giving the peer the opportunity to initiate the close
  sequence mitigates a race condition that exists when downstream clients do not drain/process
  data in a connection's receive buffer after a remote close has been detected via a socket
  write(). This race leads to such clients failing to process the response code sent by Envoy,
  which could result in erroneous downstream processing.
  
  If the timeout triggers, Envoy will close the connection's socket.
  
  The default timeout is 1000 ms if this option is not specified.
  
  .. NOTE::
     To be useful in avoiding the race condition described above, this timeout must be set
     to *at least* <max round trip time expected between clients and Envoy>+<100ms to account for
     a reasonable "worst" case processing time for a full iteration of Envoy's event loop>.
  
  .. WARNING::
     A value of 0 will completely disable delayed close processing. When disabled, the downstream
     connection's socket will be closed immediately after the write flush is completed or will
     never close if the write flush does not complete.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.access_log:

access_log
  (:ref:`config.filter.accesslog.v2.AccessLog <envoy_api_msg_config.filter.accesslog.v2.AccessLog>`) Configuration for :ref:`HTTP access logs <arch_overview_access_logs>`
  emitted by the connection manager.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.use_remote_address:

use_remote_address
  (`BoolValue <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#boolvalue>`_) If set to true, the connection manager will use the real remote address
  of the client connection when determining internal versus external origin and manipulating
  various headers. If set to false or absent, the connection manager will use the
  :ref:`config_http_conn_man_headers_x-forwarded-for` HTTP header. See the documentation for
  :ref:`config_http_conn_man_headers_x-forwarded-for`,
  :ref:`config_http_conn_man_headers_x-envoy-internal`, and
  :ref:`config_http_conn_man_headers_x-envoy-external-address` for more information.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.xff_num_trusted_hops:

xff_num_trusted_hops
  (`uint32 <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) The number of additional ingress proxy hops from the right side of the
  :ref:`config_http_conn_man_headers_x-forwarded-for` HTTP header to trust when
  determining the origin client's IP address. The default is zero if this option
  is not specified. See the documentation for
  :ref:`config_http_conn_man_headers_x-forwarded-for` for more information.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.internal_address_config:

internal_address_config
  (:ref:`config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.InternalAddressConfig <envoy_api_msg_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.InternalAddressConfig>`) Configures what network addresses are considered internal for stats and header sanitation
  purposes. If unspecified, only RFC1918 IP addresses will be considered internal.
  See the documentation for :ref:`config_http_conn_man_headers_x-envoy-internal` for more
  information about internal/external addresses.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.skip_xff_append:

skip_xff_append
  (`bool <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) If set, Envoy will not append the remote address to the
  :ref:`config_http_conn_man_headers_x-forwarded-for` HTTP header. This may be used in
  conjunction with HTTP filters that explicitly manipulate XFF after the HTTP connection manager
  has mutated the request headers. While :ref:`use_remote_address
  <envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.use_remote_address>`
  will also suppress XFF addition, it has consequences for logging and other
  Envoy uses of the remote address, so *skip_xff_append* should be used
  when only an elision of XFF addition is intended.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.via:

via
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Via header value to append to request and response headers. If this is
  empty, no via header will be appended.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.generate_request_id:

generate_request_id
  (`BoolValue <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#boolvalue>`_) Whether the connection manager will generate the :ref:`x-request-id
  <config_http_conn_man_headers_x-request-id>` header if it does not exist. This defaults to
  true. Generating a random UUID4 is expensive so in high throughput scenarios where this feature
  is not desired it can be disabled.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.preserve_external_request_id:

preserve_external_request_id
  (`bool <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Whether the connection manager will keep the :ref:`x-request-id
  <config_http_conn_man_headers_x-request-id>` header if passed for a request that is edge
  (Edge request is the request from external clients to front Envoy) and not reset it, which
  is the current Envoy behaviour. This defaults to false.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.forward_client_cert_details:

forward_client_cert_details
  (:ref:`config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.ForwardClientCertDetails <envoy_api_enum_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.ForwardClientCertDetails>`) How to handle the :ref:`config_http_conn_man_headers_x-forwarded-client-cert` (XFCC) HTTP
  header.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.set_current_client_cert_details:

set_current_client_cert_details
  (:ref:`config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.SetCurrentClientCertDetails <envoy_api_msg_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.SetCurrentClientCertDetails>`) This field is valid only when :ref:`forward_client_cert_details
  <envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.forward_client_cert_details>`
  is APPEND_FORWARD or SANITIZE_SET and the client connection is mTLS. It specifies the fields in
  the client certificate to be forwarded. Note that in the
  :ref:`config_http_conn_man_headers_x-forwarded-client-cert` header, *Hash* is always set, and
  *By* is always set when the client certificate presents the URI type Subject Alternative Name
  value.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.proxy_100_continue:

proxy_100_continue
  (`bool <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) If proxy_100_continue is true, Envoy will proxy incoming "Expect:
  100-continue" headers upstream, and forward "100 Continue" responses
  downstream. If this is false or not set, Envoy will instead strip the
  "Expect: 100-continue" header, and send a "100 Continue" response itself.
  
  

.. _envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.upgrade_configs:

upgrade_configs
  (:ref:`config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.UpgradeConfig <envoy_api_msg_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.UpgradeConfig>`) 
  
.. _envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.normalize_path:

normalize_path
  (`BoolValue <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#boolvalue>`_) Should paths be normalized according to RFC 3986 before any processing of
  requests by HTTP filters or routing? This affects the upstream *:path* header
  as well. For paths that fail this check, Envoy will respond with 400 to
  paths that are malformed. This defaults to false currently but will default
  true in the future. When not specified, this value may be overridden by the
  runtime variable
  :ref:`http_connection_manager.normalize_path<config_http_conn_man_runtime_normalize_path>`.
  See `Normalization and Comparison <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-6>`
  for details of normalization.
  Note that Envoy does not perform
  `case normalization <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-6.2.2.1>`
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.merge_slashes:

merge_slashes
  (`bool <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Determines if adjacent slashes in the path are merged into one before any processing of
  requests by HTTP filters or routing. This affects the upstream *:path* header as well. Without
  setting this option, incoming requests with path `//dir///file` will not match against route
  with `prefix` match set to `/dir`. Defaults to `false`. Note that slash merging is not part of
  `HTTP spec <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986>` and is provided for convenience.
  
  
.. _envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.HttpConnectionManager.request_id_extension:

request_id_extension
  (:ref:`config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.RequestIDExtension <envoy_api_msg_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.RequestIDExtension>`) The configuration of the request ID extension. This includes operations such as
  generation, validation, and associated tracing operations.
  
  If not set, Envoy uses the default UUID-based behavior:
  
  1. Request ID is propagated using *x-request-id* header.
  
  2. Request ID is a universally unique identifier (UUID).
  
  3. Tracing decision (sampled, forced, etc) is set in 14th byte of the UUID.

  after all other sampling checks have been applied (client-directed, force tracing, random
  sampling). This field functions as an upper limit on the total configured sampling rate. For
  instance, setting client_sampling to 100% but overall_sampling to 1% will result in only 1%
  of client requests with the appropriate headers to be force traced. This field is a direct
  analog for the runtime variable 'tracing.global_enabled' in the
  :ref:`HTTP Connection Manager <config_http_conn_man_runtime>`.
  Default: 100%

  .. attention::
    Please be aware that *envoy.tracers.opencensus* provider can only be configured once
    in Envoy lifetime.
    Any attempts to reconfigure it or to use different configurations for different HCM filters
    will be rejected.
    Such a constraint is inherent to OpenCensus itself. It cannot be overcome without changes
    on OpenCensus side.

.. _envoy_api_field_config.filter.network.http_connection_manager.v2.ScopedRoutes.ScopeKeyBuilder.FragmentBuilder.HeaderValueExtractor.KvElement.separator:

separator
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_, *REQUIRED*) The separator between key and value (e.g., '=' separates 'k=v;...').
  If an element is an empty string, the element is ignored.
  If an element contains no separator, the whole element is parsed as key and the
  fragment value is an empty string.
  If there are multiple values for a matched key, the first value is returned.
