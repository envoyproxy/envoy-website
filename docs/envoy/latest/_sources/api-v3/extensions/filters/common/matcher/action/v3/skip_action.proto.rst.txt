Common Match Actions

------------------------------------------------------

`[extensions.filters.common.matcher.action.v3.SkipFilter proto] <https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/3d77e1839c07cdf51b54fb872f60b1476043845f/api/envoy/extensions/filters/common/matcher/action/v3/skip_action.proto#L22>`_

Configuration for the SkipFilter match action. When matching results in this action, the
associated filter will be ignored for all filter callbacks (e.g. `encodeHeaders`, `encodeData`,
etc. for HTTP filters) after the matcher arrives at the match, including the callback that
caused the match result. For example, when used with a HTTP filter and the match result was
resolved after receiving the HTTP response headers, the HTTP filter will *not* receive the
response header callback.

As a result, if this match action is resolved before the first filter callback (e.g. HTTP request
headers), the filter will be completely skipped.
