Signed HTTP Exchange Filter
===========================




.. _extension_envoy.filters.http.sxg:

This extension may be referenced by the qualified name ``envoy.filters.http.sxg``


.. note::
  This extension is only available in :ref:`contrib <install_contrib>` images.


.. note::
  This extension is functional but has not had substantial production burn time, use only with this caveat.

  This extension is intended to be robust against untrusted downstream traffic. It assumes that the upstream is trusted.

.. tip::
  This extension extends and can be used with the following extension category:


  - :ref:`envoy.filters.http <extension_category_envoy.filters.http>`

.. warning::
   This API is work-in-progress and is subject to breaking changes.

SXG :ref:`configuration overview <config_http_filters_sxg>`.

.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.sxg.v3alpha.SXG.certificate:

certificate
  (:ref:`extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.SdsSecretConfig <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.SdsSecretConfig>`) The SDS configuration for the public key data for the SSL certificate that will be used to sign the
  SXG response.
  
  
.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.sxg.v3alpha.SXG.private_key:

private_key
  (:ref:`extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.SdsSecretConfig <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.SdsSecretConfig>`) The SDS configuration for the private key data for the SSL certificate that will be used to sign the
  SXG response.
  
  
.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.sxg.v3alpha.SXG.duration:

duration
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) The duration for which the generated SXG package will be valid. Default is 604800s (7 days in seconds).
  Note that in order to account for clock skew, the timestamp will be backdated by a day. So, if duration
  is set to 7 days, that will be 7 days from 24 hours ago (6 days from now). Also note that while 6/7 days
  is appropriate for most content, if the downstream service is serving Javascript, or HTML with inline
  Javascript, 1 day (so, with backdated expiry, 2 days, or 172800 seconds) is more appropriate.
  
  
.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.sxg.v3alpha.SXG.mi_record_size:

mi_record_size
  (`uint64 <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) The SXG response payload is Merkle Integrity Content Encoding (MICE) encoded (specification is [here](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-thomson-http-mice-03))
  This value indicates the record size in the encoded payload. The default value is 4096.
  
  
.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.sxg.v3alpha.SXG.cbor_url:

cbor_url
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_, *REQUIRED*) The URI of certificate CBOR file published. Since it is required that the certificate CBOR file
  be served from the same domain as the SXG document, this should be a relative URI.
  
  
.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.sxg.v3alpha.SXG.validity_url:

validity_url
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_, *REQUIRED*) URL to retrieve validity data for signature, a CBOR map. See specification [here](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-yasskin-httpbis-origin-signed-exchanges-impl-00#section-3.6)
  
  
.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.sxg.v3alpha.SXG.client_can_accept_sxg_header:

client_can_accept_sxg_header
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Header that will be set if it is determined that the client can accept SXG (typically `accept: application/signed-exchange;v=b3)
  If not set, filter will default to: `x-client-can-accept-sxg`
  
  
.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.sxg.v3alpha.SXG.should_encode_sxg_header:

should_encode_sxg_header
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Header set by downstream service to signal that the response should be transformed to SXG If not set,
  filter will default to: `x-should-encode-sxg`
  
  
.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.sxg.v3alpha.SXG.header_prefix_filters:

header_prefix_filters
  (**repeated** `string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Headers that will be stripped from the SXG document, by listing a prefix (i.e. `x-custom-` will cause
  all headers prefixed by `x-custom-` to be omitted from the SXG document)
