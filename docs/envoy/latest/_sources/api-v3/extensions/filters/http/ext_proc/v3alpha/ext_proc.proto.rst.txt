This extension may be referenced by the qualified name *envoy.filters.http.ext_proc*

.. note::
  This extension is functional but has not had substantial production burn time, use only with this caveat.

  This extension has an unknown security posture and should only be used in deployments where both the downstream and upstream are trusted.

.. tip::
  This extension extends and can be used with the following extension category:


  - :ref:`envoy.filters.http <extension_category_envoy.filters.http>`

.. warning::
   This API is work-in-progress and is subject to breaking changes.

External Processing Filter


The External Processing filter allows an external service to act on HTTP traffic in a flexible way.


**Current Implementation Status:**
The filter will send the "request_headers" and "response_headers" messages by default.
In addition, if the "processing mode" is set , the "request_body" and "response_body"
messages will be sent if the corresponding fields of the "processing_mode" are
set to BUFFERED, and trailers will be sent if the corresponding fields are set
to SEND. The other body processing modes are not
implemented yet. The filter will also respond to "immediate_response" messages
at any point in the stream.


As designed, the filter supports up to six different processing steps, which are in the
process of being implemented:
* Request headers: IMPLEMENTED
* Request body: Only BUFFERED mode is implemented
* Request trailers: IMPLEMENTED
* Response headers: IMPLEMENTED
* Response body: Only BUFFERED mode is implemented
* Response trailers: IMPLEMENTED


The filter communicates with an external gRPC service that can use it to do a variety of things
with the request and response:

* Access and modify the HTTP headers on the request, response, or both
* Access and modify the HTTP request and response bodies
* Access and modify the dynamic stream metadata
* Immediately send an HTTP response downstream and terminate other processing

The filter communicates with the server using a gRPC bidirectional stream. After the initial
request, the external server is in control over what additional data is sent to it
and how it should be processed.

By implementing the protocol specified by the stream, the external server can choose:

* Whether it receives the response message at all
* Whether it receives the message body at all, in separate chunks, or as a single buffer
* Whether subsequent HTTP requests are transmitted synchronously or whether they are
  sent asynchronously.
* To modify request or response trailers if they already exist
* To add request or response trailers where they are not present

All of this together allows a server to process the filter traffic in fairly
sophisticated ways. For example:

* A server may choose to examine all or part of the HTTP message bodies depending
  on the content of the headers.
* A server may choose to immediately reject some messages based on their HTTP
  headers (or other dynamic metadata) and more carefully examine others
* A server may asynchronously monitor traffic coming through the filter by inspecting
  headers, bodies, or both, and then decide to switch to a synchronous processing
  mode, either permanently or temporarily.

The protocol itself is based on a bidirectional gRPC stream. Envoy will send the
server
:ref:`ProcessingRequest <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.ext_proc.v3alpha.ProcessingRequest>`
messages, and the server must reply with
:ref:`ProcessingResponse <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.ext_proc.v3alpha.ProcessingResponse>`.

grpc_service
  (:ref:`config.core.v3.GrpcService <envoy_v3_api_msg_config.core.v3.GrpcService>`) Configuration for the gRPC service that the filter will communicate with.
  The filter supports both the "Envoy" and "Google" gRPC clients.
  
  
.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3alpha.ExternalProcessor.failure_mode_allow:

failure_mode_allow
  (`bool <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) By default, if the gRPC stream cannot be established, or if it is closed
  prematurely with an error, the filter will fail. Specifically, if the
  response headers have not yet been delivered, then it will return a 500
  error downstream. If they have been delivered, then instead the HTTP stream to the
  downstream client will be reset.
  With this parameter set to true, however, then if the gRPC stream is prematurely closed
  or could not be opened, processing continues without error.
  
  
.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3alpha.ExternalProcessor.processing_mode:

processing_mode
  (:ref:`extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3alpha.ProcessingMode <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3alpha.ProcessingMode>`) Specifies default options for how HTTP headers, trailers, and bodies are
  sent. See ProcessingMode for details.
  
  



.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.ext_proc.v3alpha.ExternalProcessor.message_timeout:

message_timeout
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) Specifies the timeout for each individual message sent on the stream and
  when the filter is running in synchronous mode. Whenever
  the proxy sends a message on the stream that requires a response, it will
  reset this timer, and will stop processing and return an error (subject
  to the processing mode) if the timer expires before a matching response.
  is received. There is no timeout when the filter is running in asynchronous
  mode. Default is 200 milliseconds.
