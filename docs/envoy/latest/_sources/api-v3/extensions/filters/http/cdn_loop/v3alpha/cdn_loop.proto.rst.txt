.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.cdn_loop.v3alpha.CdnLoopConfig.cdn_id:

cdn_id
  (`string <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_, *REQUIRED*) The CDN identifier to use for loop checks and to append to the
  CDN-Loop header.
  
  RFC 8586 calls this the cdn-id. The cdn-id can either be a
  pseudonym or hostname the CDN is in control of.
  
  cdn_id must not be empty.
  
  
.. _envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.filters.http.cdn_loop.v3alpha.CdnLoopConfig.max_allowed_occurrences:

max_allowed_occurrences
  (`uint32 <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) The maximum allowed count of cdn_id in the downstream CDN-Loop
  request header.
  
  The default of 0 means a request can transit the CdnLoopFilter
  once. A value of 1 means that a request can transit the
  CdnLoopFilter twice and so on.
