1.17.1 (February 25, 2021)
===========================






Bug fixes
---------

*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*



* **jwt_authn**: reject requests with a proper error if JWT has the wrong issuer when allow_missing is used. Before this change, the requests are accepted.
* **overload**: fix a bug that can cause use-after-free when one scaled timer disables another one with the same duration.
