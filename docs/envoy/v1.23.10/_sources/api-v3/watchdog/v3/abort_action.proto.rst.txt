-----------------------------

:repo:`[watchdog.v3.AbortActionConfig proto] <api/envoy/watchdog/v3/abort_action.proto#L21>`

A GuardDogAction that will terminate the process by killing the
stuck thread. This would allow easier access to the call stack of the stuck
thread since we would run signal handlers on that thread. By default
this will be registered to run as the last watchdog action on KILL and
MULTIKILL events if those are enabled.
