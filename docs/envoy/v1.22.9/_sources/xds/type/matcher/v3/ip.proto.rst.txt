.. _envoy_v3_api_msg_.xds.type.matcher.v3.IPMatcher:

.xds.type.matcher.v3.IPMatcher
------------------------------

`[.xds.type.matcher.v3.IPMatcher proto] <https://github.com/cncf/xds/blob/main/xds/type/matcher/v3/ip.proto#L20>`_

Matches a specific IP address against a set of possibly overlapping subnets using a trie.

.. _envoy_v3_api_field_.xds.type.matcher.v3.IPMatcher.range_matchers:

range_matchers
  (**repeated** :ref:`.xds.type.matcher.v3.IPMatcher.IPRangeMatcher <envoy_v3_api_msg_.xds.type.matcher.v3.IPMatcher.IPRangeMatcher>`) Match IP address by CIDR ranges.
  
  
.. _envoy_v3_api_msg_.xds.type.matcher.v3.IPMatcher.IPRangeMatcher:

.xds.type.matcher.v3.IPMatcher.IPRangeMatcher
---------------------------------------------

`[.xds.type.matcher.v3.IPMatcher.IPRangeMatcher proto] <https://github.com/cncf/xds/blob/main/xds/type/matcher/v3/ip.proto#L22>`_

Specifies a list of IP address ranges and a match action.

.. code-block:: json

  {
    "ranges": [],
    "on_match": "{...}",
    "exclusive": "..."
  }

.. _envoy_v3_api_field_.xds.type.matcher.v3.IPMatcher.IPRangeMatcher.ranges:

ranges
  (**repeated** :ref:`.xds.core.v3.CidrRange <envoy_v3_api_msg_.xds.core.v3.CidrRange>`, *REQUIRED*) A non-empty set of CIDR ranges.
  
  
.. _envoy_v3_api_field_.xds.type.matcher.v3.IPMatcher.IPRangeMatcher.on_match:

on_match
  (:ref:`.xds.type.matcher.v3.Matcher.OnMatch <envoy_v3_api_msg_.xds.type.matcher.v3.Matcher.OnMatch>`) Match action to apply when the IP address is within one of the CIDR ranges.
  
  
.. _envoy_v3_api_field_.xds.type.matcher.v3.IPMatcher.IPRangeMatcher.exclusive:

exclusive
  (`bool <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto#scalar>`_) Indicates whether this match option should be considered if there is a
  more specific matcher. Exclusive matchers are not selected whenever a
  more specific matcher exists (e.g. matcher with a longer prefix) even
  when the more specific matcher fails its nested match condition.
  Non-exclusive matchers are considered if the more specific matcher
  exists but its nested match condition does not entirely match.
  Non-exclusive matchers are selected in the order of their specificity
  first (longest prefix first), then the order of declaration next.
  
  For example, consider two range matchers: an exclusive matcher *X* on
  ``0.0.0.0/0`` and a matcher *Y* on ``192.0.0.0/2`` with a nested match
  condition *Z*. For the input IP ``192.168.0.1`` matcher *Y* is the most
  specific. If its nested match condition *Z* does not accept the input,
  then the less specific matcher *X* does not apply either despite the
  input being within the range, because matcher *X* is exclusive.
  
  The opposite is true if matcher *X* is not marked as exclusive. In that
  case matcher *X* always matches whenever matcher "*Y* rejects the input.
