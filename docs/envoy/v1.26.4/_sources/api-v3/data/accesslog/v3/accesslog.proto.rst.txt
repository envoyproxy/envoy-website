gRPC access logs (proto)
========================


Envoy access logs describe incoming interaction with Envoy over a fixed
period of time, and typically cover a single request/response exchange,
(e.g. HTTP), stream (e.g. over HTTP/gRPC), or proxied connection (e.g. TCP).
Access logs contain fields defined in protocol-specific protobuf messages.

Except where explicitly declared otherwise, all fields describe
*downstream* interaction between Envoy and a connected client.
Fields describing *upstream* interaction will explicitly include ``upstream``
in their name.

time_to_first_upstream_tx_byte
  (`Duration <https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/google.protobuf#duration>`_) Interval between the first downstream byte received and the first upstream byte sent. There may
  by considerable delta between ``time_to_last_rx_byte`` and this value due to filters.
  Additionally, the same caveats apply as documented in ``time_to_last_downstream_tx_byte`` about
  not accounting for kernel socket buffer time, etc.

  selection.

  This can be used to associate IDs attached to the various configurations
  used to process this request with the access log entry. For example, a
  route created from a higher level forwarding rule with some ID can place
  that ID in this field and cross reference later. It can also be used to
  determine if a canary endpoint was used or not.


.. _envoy_v3_api_field_data.accesslog.v3.AccessLogCommon.upstream_transport_failure_reason:

  And if it is necessary, unique ID or identifier can be added to the log entry
  :ref:`stream_id <envoy_v3_api_field_data.accesslog.v3.AccessLogCommon.stream_id>` to
  correlate all these intermediate log entries and final log entry.
