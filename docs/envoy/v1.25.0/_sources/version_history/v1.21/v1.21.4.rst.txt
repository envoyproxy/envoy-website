1.21.4 (June 14, 2022)
=======================





Minor behavior changes
----------------------

*Changes that may cause incompatibilities for some users, but should not for most*



* **tls**: if both :ref:`match_subject_alt_names <v1.21:envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.CertificateValidationContext.match_subject_alt_names>` and :ref:`match_typed_subject_alt_names <v1.21:envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.transport_sockets.tls.v3.CertificateValidationContext.match_typed_subject_alt_names>` are specified, the former (deprecated) field is ignored. Previously, setting both fields would result in an error.



Bug fixes
---------

*Changes expected to improve the state of the world and are unlikely to have negative effects*



* **docker**: update Docker images (``distroless`` -> ``d65ac1a``) to resolve CVE issues in container packages.
